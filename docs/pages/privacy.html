        <p>
          Confidentiality policy document on the use of confidential data by the
          application. This document describes what data is used by the 
          application and for what purposes. 
        </p>
        <h2>User information</h2>
        <p>
          Power Editor does not collect 
          user information.  App can use your device's local account or Microsoft account to sync and store your settings and preferences. 
        </p>
        <h2>Storage usage</h2>
        <p>
          Power Editor requires full access to the file system for normal work, as the application can edit folders and files outside of the application's internal files. If the user does not grant permission to the file system, the application will not be able to edit the files as expected. By default, the application has access to the system libraries (Music, Pictures, Documents, Videos, Removable Devices). If you use Xbox, please save and work with files in these libraries because there is no support for file system permission on Xbox.
